A reimplementaton of Bitset I coded over the weekend.


input - sets given bit to 1

reset - sets given bit to 0

check - checks if given bit is 1

show - prints the 1 bits (optional, you can set the start and end of the 'for' loop)

count - counts the 1 bits (optional, you can set the start and end of the 'for' loop)


To use it:
#include "bitset_0.3.h"


I'll try to make it more efficient. The RAM usage is very similar to the original bitset, but some operations take a bit longer. Also, I'll try to rewrite it so I could use a dynamic array.
